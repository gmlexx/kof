# Alert System

## Overview

The alerting system is designed to help receive and manage alerts effectively. It consists of two main components:

* **VM Alert:** This component evaluates alerting rules based on metric data and sends alerts to the VMAlertmanager for further processing.
* **VM Alert Manager:** This component routes and sends alerts to various receivers. It handles the aggregation and routing of alerts triggered by VMAlert.

Both objects are created only if the corresponding flags are enabled in the values file:

* ```victoriametrics.enabled```
* ```victoriametrics.vmalert.enabled```

## Receivers Configuration

To configure the alerting system, you need to set the appropriate parameters in the [mothership](https://github.com/k0rdent/kof/blob/main/charts/kof-mothership/values.yaml) values file. This configuration defines how alerts are processed, routed, and delivered to the desired notification channels.

### Example

In this example, the configuration enables VMAlert and sets up a receiver for Microsoft Teams notifications:

```yaml
vmalert:
  enabled: true
  remoteRead: ""
  vmalertmanager: 
    config: |
      global:
          resolve_timeout: 5m
      route:
          receiver: teams-notifier
          group_interval: 5m
          repeat_interval: 12h
      receivers:
          - name: teams-notifier
          msteams_configs:
              - webhook_url: <YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL_HERE>
              title: '{{ .Status | toUpper }}'
              text: '{{ template "msteams.default.text" . }}'
```

For more detailed information on configuring other receivers and further customizations, please refer to the [Alertmanager configuration specification](https://github.com/VictoriaMetrics/VictoriaMetrics/blob/master/docs/victoriametrics-cloud/alertmanager-setup-for-deployment.md#alertmanager-config-specification).

## Example of Received Alert

Below is an example of an alert message generated by the system.

```text
Alert Firing:
Labels:
    alertname = KubeAPIDown
    alertgroup = kubernetes-system-apiserver
    severity = critical
Annotations:
    description = KubeAPI has disappeared from Prometheus target discovery.
    runbook_url = https://runbooks.prometheus-operator.dev/runbooks/kubernetes/kubeapidown
    summary = Target disappeared from Prometheus target discovery.
